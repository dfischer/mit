    VM instruction descriptor.

     - effect - StackEffect or None.
     - code - Code.
     - opcode - int or None - opcode number, defaults to the number of
       instructions before adding this one.
     - terminal - bool - this instruction is terminal: the rest of `ir` is its
       argument.
     - is_variadic - bool - true if this instruction is variadic.

    C variables are created for the arguments and results; the arguments are
    popped and results pushed.

    There are special macros available to instructions; see run.h.
