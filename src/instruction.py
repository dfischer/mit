    VM instruction descriptor.

     - terminal_action - Action or None - if given, this instruction is
       terminal: the rest of `ir` is its argument, and the Action gives the
       implementation for the case when `ir` is non-zero.

    C variables are created for the arguments and results; the arguments are
    popped and results pushed.

    There are special macros available to instructions; see run.h.
