    VM instruction instruction descriptor.

     - effect - StackEffect or None.

     - terminal - bool - this instruction is terminal: `ir` must be zero on
       entry.

    C variables are created for the arguments and results; the arguments are
    popped and results pushed.

    There are special macros available to instructions; see run.h.
