    VM instruction instruction descriptor.

     - opcode - int - opcode number
     - args, results - lists of str, acceptable to StackPicture.of().
       If both are `None`, then the instruction has an arbitrary stack
       effect.
     - code - str - C source code
     - terminal - bool - this instruction is terminal: I must be zero on
       entry.

    C variables are created for the arguments and results; the arguments are
    popped and results pushed.

    The code should RAISE any error before writing any state, so that if an
    error is raised, the state of the VM is not changed.
