    VM instruction instruction descriptor.

     - opcode - int - opcode number
     - args, results - lists of str, acceptable to StackPicture.of().
       If both are `None`, then the instruction has an arbitrary stack
       effect.
     - code - str - C source code
     - init_code - str - C source code to run before stack checks; arguments
       are not yet available. This is used to implement internal extra
       instructions.

    C variables are created for the arguments and results; the arguments are
    popped and results pushed.

    The code should RAISE any error before writing any state, so that if an
    error is raised, the state of the VM is not changed.
