# Test the arithmetic instructions. Also uses the `swap` and `pop`
# instructions, and numbers. Since unsigned arithmetic overflow behaviour is
# guaranteed by the ISO C standard, we only test the stack handling and
# basic correctness of the instructions here, assuming that if the arithmetic
# works in one case, it will work in all.
